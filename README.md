# Forms-using-HTML-and-CSS
I created a form using HTML and CSS, focusing on accessibility and design. Structured with labeled inputs, it uses CSS grid and flexbox for a responsive layout. I added hover effects, styled error messages, and ensured a modern, user-friendly design. The form adapts across devices, showcasing my ability to combine functionality with visual appeal.
